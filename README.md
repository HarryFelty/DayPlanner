# DayPlanner

## Description

This project was created to demonstrate the use of jQuery functions and Dayjs, as well as navigating the DOM. Aside from this, the project was built to serve a practical use as a day planner. It solves the problem of not having a physical day planner, or an easy-to-use digital day planner. This day planner is simple, user friendly, yet effective. I learned much about the technologies used, such as Dayjs, jQuery, and gained more experience navigating the DOM.

## Usage

This project can be used to plan out the day. It included the hours 9am-5pm, but more could be added. Upon saving entries, they remain saved until local storage is cleared, or they overwritten. This project can also be used for educational purposes to demonstrate practical used for jQuery, Dayjs, and DOM traversal.
